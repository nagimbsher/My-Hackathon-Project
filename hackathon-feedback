Shopping Website

I want to say I am very impressed with your progress in the course ! 
You made a very nice website and used functions , if statements and dom manipulation.
You did have some bugs when i opend the website but most is good.
You products I would add to the dom not straight into the html file but I would have maybe an array of objects
where each object is an item with its name price and image- and then in javascript you can do a forEach loop and for each object in the array create
an element in your html.

Fantastic job and waiting to see what you do next !!!!
